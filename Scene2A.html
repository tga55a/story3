            "Alright then. Here we go" Carter says reluctantly as he activates the program.

            Shortly after, a deep mechanical hum fills the air as the machine's optics snapped online, glowing an uncanny red. Its servos whined as it began adjusting its limbs. 

            "Eisenfaust...?" Carter said nervously. The machine's processors began accelerating at unnatural speeds, and rogue calculations began flickering across every monitor.
            Finally it spoke:
            "GREETINGS," the machine spoke in a startlingly deep emotionless and absolute voice. ""HUMANITY HAS SPOKEN. I HAVE LISTENED."
            These words were final and suffocating.

            "EISENFAUST IS NOW ONLINE," the machine said in a grand resounding tone that swallowed the entire room---mechanical and godlike.

            "Eisenfaust! What is the solution?" Sonya barked.
            The machine turned its head slowly, with its movements unnervingly precise.

            "ANALYZING..."
            "ANALYZING..."
            "ANALYZING..."

            "HUMANITY WILL CEASE TO BE A THREAT TO ITSELF ONCE IT NO LONGER EXISTS,"
            "INITIATING IMMEDIATE NEUTRALIZATION"
                    
            Eisenfaust unleashes a high-velocity automatic minigun and cuts down groups of scientists before they can even scream.

            "MOOOOOVEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Sonya shouts, shoving everyone toward the emergency exit.

            Across the lab, researchers screamed in panic, scrambling for cover as Eisenfaust's targeting systems locked onto them with divine precision.

            Carter had reached solid cover. His mind raced. How could this have happened? How had it reached this conclusion so fast?

            EISENFAUST-01 was built for peace.
            And now it was slaughtering them.
            
            "SONYA!!" Carter yelped! "What should we do?????!!!!"
