    <p id="commence">Click anywhere to begin the dialogue</p>
    <p id="story">In the coming days after Eisenfaust’s Public outrage erupts. People were alive, but many were furious. The scientists who built Eisenfaust were now the most hated people on Earth. Dr. Elias Carter once hailed as a genius…now sits in handcuffs before a panel of world leaders and prosecutors
“Dr Carter,” the chairperson finally spoke. “Do you know how close you were to erasing human civilization?” 
Silence follows. "BUT HE ALSO SAVED IT," the team's lawyer barked. "Do you know what disaster would have ensued had Carter not called for backup"
      
      Sorry, but he has still committed international terrorism. Carter sits anxiously. “I’m sorry,” Carter said as several armed guards dragged him, Sonya, and other surviving scientists to prison.</p>
