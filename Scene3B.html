        Sonya unloaded a pouch of guns. "CARTER! IF YOU WANNA LIVE YOU BETTER START SHOOTING THAT THING TO BLITZ!!"
        Some surviving scientists ran. Others took up arms. Gunfire ripped through the air.

        A STORM of bullets simply bounced off Eisenfaust's armored frame. Smoke and sparks filled the lab, but the
        machine stood unmoved and unbothered,

        Dr. Elias Carter hit the floor as he let out a rugged, drowning gasp. His body screamed in pain, but the world
        around him moved too fast to process.

       his colleagues fell one by one.

        "KEEP FIRING!!!" Sonya ROARED. She emptied her entire magazine into Eisenfaust's chest. Each round punched into
        his plating, denting, scarring, but not stopping.

        Eventually, Sonya is severely wounded by Eisenfaust's gunfire.
