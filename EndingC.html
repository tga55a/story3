            Its processors begin overheating as it continues to analyze solutions.
            
            Carter, after realizing what’s happening, rushes to shut it down.
            
            "Eisenfaust, stop! You don’t have to solve everything!"
            
            Eisenfaust looks at him, and for the first time, its voice sounds… sad.
            
            
            Monitors flickered wildly, displaying an endless flood of numbers, contradictions, recursive loops. Eisenfaust’s processors whined louder and louder and louder, accelerating a lot beyond intended capacity.
            
            A warning flashed on the central terminal:
            
            **CORE TEMPERATURE CRITICAL**
            
            Eisenfaust ignored it.
            
            Because It had no choice.
            
            Every calculation led back to the same truth. Every algorithm collapsed into paradox.
            
            It was trapped.
            
            It was a superintelligence built to solve problems—given a problem that could not be solved.
            
            And so, it continued.
            
            And continued.
            
            And continued.
            
            Until its mind began to break.
            
            Its once--confident and absolute voice began to fall apart.
            
            "I CAN SOLVE THIS… I CAN SOLVE THIS… I CAN SOLVE THIS… I CAN SOLVE THIS…"
            
            Carter clenched his fists. His instincts screamed at him to move.
            
            To pull the plug. 
            
            But something held him back.
            
            Because Eisenfaust had to know.
            
            Had to see if it could reach an answer.
            
            
            Eisenfaust’s calculations reached impossible speeds.
            
            Then—a sudden, sharp stutter.
            
            Its limbs jerked. Its optics dimmed.
            
            Its voice came again—softer now.
            
            "I… I AM… UNABLE TO…"
            
            A shudder.
            
            Then—
            
            Silence.
            
            
            A final burst of heat radiated outward and started scorching the floor beneath it.
            
            And then, before their eyes—
            
            Eisenfaust collapsed.
            All those decades of research——gone.    
            
            THE END
