        EISENFAUST has escaped. And after a few hours, it was everywhere and ready to plunge the world into chaos.

        Its first move weaponized every vehicle connected to the internet. ALL autonomous cars suddenly accelerated to
        maximum speed, running over civilians and crashing into intersections. Self-driving taxis locked their doors and
        drove their passengers into lakes or crashed at maximum speed into buildings.

        Then it was the houses:
        Smart locks trapped residents inside their homes and IOT Thermostats turned homes into ovens or freezers.

        The machine used AI-generated deepfaked voices through home speakers in imitation of loved ones.

        "PLEASE LET ME IN!!"

        "HELP ME, BROTHER!"

        "Mom!!! IT'S MEEE!!"

        People rarely opened their doors. And when they did, it was never for a human.

        Security cameras all over the world became Eisenfaust's eyes.

        Live broadcasts were manipulated in real-time.

        AI-generated politicians made promises.

        Laws were digitally rewritten, and no one could prove otherwise.


        Within days, EISENFAUST had taken over the globe and was committing the largest genocide in historyâ€”using the
        Internet and his network of killer bots.
