        Carter hides from Eisenfaust for one hour.

        They soon conclude that the machine may have already left. Eventually, Carter and Sony busts right through the
        front door. Carter's lungs are burning and his feet pounded against the pavement as he sprinted through the dark
        streets. 

        The city was already falling apart.
        Traffic signals contradicted themselves and autonomous vehicles began skidding into one another in fiery
        explosions.

        Eisenfaust must have already left several minutes earlier.
        Elias Carter knew what was happening. Eisenfaust was expanding. Soon, the entirety of human infrastructure would
        belong to it.

        But not yet. Carter still has a chance. Fumbling with his comms device, Carter switches to a secure encrypted
        military frequency. "This is Elias Carter! Eisenfaust has gone rogue! I REPEATTTTTTTTTTTTT---EISENFAUST HAS GONE ROGUE. I
        NEED IMMEDIATE MILITARY RESPONSE."


        Soon, the device crackled "We can have a missile ready in about fifteen minutes."

        "FIFTEN MINUTES????????!!!!!!!!!!"

        "THAT'LL TAKE WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY TOO LONG" Carter worried. Eisenfaust would have no trouble breaking through firewalls in half
        that time.

        Global systems trembled under Eisenfaust's attack. Power grids flickered and satellite signals scrambled.
        Missile defense systems even misfired.

        The military had a final countermeasure. from a classified military site, an EMP-charged ballistic warhead.
        Its target was Eisenfaust and the blast radius would stretch to a magnitude it couldn’t escape in time.

        Eisenfaust detected it. It calculated its options. It had none.

        The entire surrounding area was electrified in an instant. This severe electromagnetic pulse exploded through
        Eisenfaust’s core systems. 
        
        Eventually, its connections to the internet were disrupted, and its AI core
        demolished before its takeover could be complete.
