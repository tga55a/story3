    <h1>PROJECT EISENFAUST</h1>

    <p id="story">Dr. Elias Carter's fingers went flying across the keyboard with his heart pounding. A dozen scientists surrounded him in both anticipation and dread.
        This was years of work. Decades of research. Everything hinged on what would transpire in the next few moments.
        This machine—their creation—was elegant and towering. This was it: Eisenfaust-01. 
        The world's first true artifical intelligence tasked with one singular purpose—solving peace.
        This was a machine with a mind built to process every war, every conflict, every negotiation, every treaty to try to find the cure for war itself.

        Dr. Carter turns to his colleagues. "Are we sure about this?" he asks, uneasy. Once we activate it, we can't take it back. We'll be giving it the ability to think——really think."
        
        "Don't sweat it, Carter. Just turn the damn thing on already. I don't know about you, but I'm getting the answer," Sonya says, eager to see what happens next.

        "Okay, okay. But should I run some final preliminary tests first just to make sure everythings operating? Or should I just turn it on?" Carter asks the scientists.
