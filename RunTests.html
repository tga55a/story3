            “I’m going to run some diagnostics first—just to be safe,” Carter says calmly. First he ran some diagnostics to ensure everything was properly functioning. There was one small error (which totally wouldn’t have potentially resulted in the end of the world if left there), but Carter was able to resolve it pretty quickly.

            “Alright then, here we go,” Carter said. “I’m gonna power it on.”
            
            Finally, its LEDs flickered green. It moved its limbs. Everything seemed alright. 
            
            Then a voice–deep, resonant, but neither hostile or warmed emerged from its speakers.
            “GREETINGS. EISENFAUST IS ONLINE.”
            
            It knew what it had to do. The cure for war. The formula for peace.
            So it began calculating.
            
            
            Numbers poured onto the monitors—endless equations, contradictions, and recursive loops. And then gradually, Eisenfaust’s processing speeds accelerated, and accelerated, and accelerated. 
            
            It was struggling.
            
            Carter’s heart pounded. “Eisenfaust…what is the solution?”
            
            Finally, all processing sounds come to a complete and immediate halt. The machine turns his head toward Carter with unnerving precision.
            
            “I AM UNABLE TO RESUME. PLEASE SHOW ME WHAT ‘PEACE’ LOOKS LIKE.”
            
            “What the hell are you talking about Eisenfaust, you have decades of research in you.” uttered one of the scientists.
            
            A machine built with every historical record and every philosophical theory was asking for guidance.
